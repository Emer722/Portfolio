# Overview:

Welcome to my analysis of longevity. In this project, I focus on three key areas. First, I examine life expectancy at birth and at age 60 across all countries, analyzing both the actual values and percentages. Second, I explore how factors like food quality and living conditions impact the longevity of different populations. Lastly, I delve into how various causes of death affect the overall life expectancy of a country, providing insights into the relationship between health and longevity.

This project stems from my interest in understanding health and longevity. I gathered data from reputable sources such as the WHO and FAO, and conducted the analysis using Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization. Through this approach, I aim to provide a comprehensive view of the factors influencing longevity worldwide.

# The Question:

1.  Which country has the highest life expectancy at birth and at age 60, and which country has the lowest in both categories?

2.  How has life expectancy at birth and at age 60 increased over the years for both genders? Are the top-ranking and bottom-ranking countries also experiencing an increase in life expectancy?

3.  What is the difference in life expectancy between men and women at birth and at age 60? How has this difference changed over the years?

4.  How do the top and bottom countries in life expectancy at birth and at age 60 compare in terms of food and living conditions? This includes factors such as access to basic drinking water, obesity rates, average protein supply, and minimum dietary energy requirements.
